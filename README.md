## Why TinyWasm?

- **Tiny**: TinyWasm is designed to be as small as possible without significantly compromising performance or functionality (< 4000 LLOC).
- **Portable**: TinyWasm runs on any platform that Rust can target, including `no_std`, with minimal external dependencies.
- **Safe**: No unsafe code is used in the runtime (`rkyv` which uses unsafe code can be used for serialization, but is optional).

## Status

TinyWasm passes all WebAssembly MVP tests from the [WebAssembly core testsuite](https://github.com/WebAssembly/testsuite) and is able to run most WebAssembly programs. Additionally, the current 2.0 Draft is mostly supported, with the exception of Fixed-Width SIMD and Memory64/Multiple Memories. See the [Supported Proposals](#supported-proposals) section for more information.

## Usage

See the [examples](./examples) directory and [documentation](https://docs.rs/tinywasm) for more information on how to use TinyWasm.
For testing purposes, you can also use the `tinywasm-cli` tool:

```sh
$ cargo install tinywasm-cli
$ tinywasm-cli --help
```

## Feature Flags

- **`std`**\
  Enables the use of `std` and `std::io` for parsing from files and streams. This is enabled by default.
- **`logging`**\
  Enables logging using the `log` crate. This is enabled by default.
- **`parser`**\
  Enables the `tinywasm-parser` crate. This is enabled by default.
- **`archive`**\
  Enables pre-parsing of archives. This is enabled by default.

With all these features disabled, TinyWasm only depends on `core`, `alloc` ,and `libm` and can be used in `no_std` environments.
Since `libm` is not as performant as the compiler's math intrinsics, it is recommended to use the `std` feature if possible (at least [for now](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/2505)), especially on wasm32 targets.

## Inspiration

Big thanks to the authors of the following projects, which have inspired and influenced TinyWasm:

- [wasmi](https://github.com/wasmi-labs/wasmi) - an efficient and lightweight WebAssembly interpreter that also runs on `no_std` environments
- [wasm3](https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3) - a high performance WebAssembly interpreter written in C
- [wazero](https://wazero.io/) - a zero-dependency WebAssembly interpreter written in go
- [wain](https://github.com/rhysd/wain) - a zero-dependency WebAssembly interpreter written in Rust

I encourage you to check these projects out if you're looking for more mature and feature-complete WebAssembly Runtimes.
